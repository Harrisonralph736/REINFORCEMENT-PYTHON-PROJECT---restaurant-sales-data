# REINFORCEMENT-PYTHON-PROJECT---restaurant-sales-data
This project analyzes order data, cleaning missing values using the mode, performs a one-sample t-test on order totals versus a fixed value, and visualizes data distributions and categories with histograms, KDE plots, and countplots for clear insights and reporting.
